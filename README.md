First, I navigated to the default log directory and took a look.

Next, we took a look inside some application logs such nginx server.

I had a look inside some of the other logs such as syslog.

Next up, I moved into the journal directory to view directories with logs stored for each boot process.

I gave the command to view the ordered list of boots, 0 being the current boot.

Next, I took a deeper look at the '0'/current boot.
